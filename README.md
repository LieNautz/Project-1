# Corgi-Rescue 

# Objective
The purpose of this project was to build my personal website from scratch to demonstrate my some of my current abilities with HTML and CSS with this being the first project in my portfolio as a beginner web developer.

# Goal
Demonstrate basic HTML and CSS, specifically using Flexbox for compatability across various devices.

# Description
I love dogs and especially  Corgi's, and although i don't own a Corgi as of yet one of my goals is to own one in the future as they are just adorable and would be a good morale booster as well.

Demonstrate basic HTML elements and attributes to create a solid layout and an interactive webpage. 

The 'Content' section uses anchor tags to redirect you to specific sections on the website using IDs. 

The 'Gallery' and 'Recent Rescue' is to demonstrate my skills with flexbox and flex directions which allows me to ensure the content is responsive with mobile devices or any other devices you may use to interact with the website. 

I have also opted to use the 'form' take to create a semi-functional  form to gather user information with required inputs needed to proceed further, although the data cannot be stored i'm hoping to implement this in the future once i have a further understanding of JS. 

Lastly, the 'Our Sponsors' section utilizes anchor tags nested within images to redirect users to the 'sponsors' direct site. Please note these are not real sponsors and are only used for educational purposes.

# Next Step
Moving forward i would like to utilize JS more to make 'smarter' forms to send user information to database  where it can be stored and retrieved. 

Overall, i would like to add more interactive projects to my portfolio as i continue in becoming a web developer.
